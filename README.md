 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MATT a junior majoring in Computer Science at Mississippi State University 

I'm a college student who lives in the United States. I'm learning how to code.. It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++ and Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning  Python, Data Structures and C++.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating webpages and learning how to progam.
ðŸ˜€ I like to play basketball, code, read, and workout.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about NBA history.
âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
